- You can use QuickRecorder to record your screens / windows / applications / mobile devices... etc.

## Q&A
**1. Where can I reopen the main panel after closing it?**
> Click the Dock tile or Menubar icon of QuickRecorder to reopen the main panel at any time.

**2. Why does QuickRecorder not a sandbox app?**
> QuickRecorder has no plans to be uploaded to the App Store, so it does not need to be designed as a sandbox app.  

**3. How to independently control the volume of system sound and sound from microphone in other video editor?**
> QuickRecorder will merge the audio input from the microphone to the main audio track after recording by default. If you need to edit the video, you can turn off the `Record Microphone to Main Track` option in the settings panel. After turning off, the system sound and sound from microphone will be recorded into two audio tracks and can be edited independently.
